# What's What?

This benchmarking tool is designed to be a flexible tool for
displaying STARS data for specific institutions and/or reports
and for groups of institutions and/or reports.

## Search Filters

We use these to find and select STARS Reports.

## Entities

Entities are either specific institution submissions, or groups of them.

### Institution Submissions

Institution Submissions are by default the latest submission,
but can be identified by version(s). This means that an Institution
Submission could be their 2.0 submission or their 2.0 and 2.1 submissions.

When displayed, each version will have its own row.

### Ad-hoc Groups

These are groups of institution submissions specifically selected by
the user.

### Filtered Groups

These are really just a saved set of filters used to generate a list of
institution submissions.

## Data Filters

These filters are used to select specific data from STARS to display
for the reports selected by the user.
