# State Shape

The heart of the application is the state. So, we'll start by
talking about what that is. For a bit of background on the terms
used below, see [What's What?](../introduction/WhatIsWhat.md).

## The Basics

Essentially, we are just storing a few things:

    {
      entities: {...},
      dataPoints: {...},
      viewData: {...},
    }
